# Web-Development
A project to showcase my Front End Web Development skills . It is also a valuable learning experience as I am expanding my knowledge in Software Development. The language used is HTML5 and CSS and Bootstrap Framework. For one to design such a web page you'll have to download Bootstrap Framework, have a text editor like Visual Studio Code, install a live server and view the page on any browser.
